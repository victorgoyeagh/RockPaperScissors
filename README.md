## User ​Story:

As a games player, I'd like to play rock, paper, scissors so that I can spend an hour of my day having fun.

## Required ​functionality:

The ability to play against the computer.

## Technical ​Constraints:

Use modern web development techniques. Using a JavaScript framework such as Angular or React would be preferable.

## Don't ​know ​the ​game?

## Guidance:

- Approach the exercise as if you’re building the application for production. How would you ensure a high quality, maintainable solution?

- As a rough guide it should take around 2-3 hours, but feel free to spend a bit more time to create a solution you’re happy with.

- Include a sentence or two on how you approached the problem and what you’d improve, given more time.

- Simple, clear solutions are perfectly acceptable. There’s no need to over-engineer. Please include instructions on how to run the application and tests.
